# This code is a Python script for a machine learning project to analyze and predict customer churn in a telecom company. It involves data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, addressing class imbalance, and data visualization using various charts. Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. Import Libraries: The script begins by importing necessary Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE), matplotlib, seaborn, and various machine learning classifiers.

2. Read Data: The data is loaded from a CSV file named "task 2.csv" using pandas and displayed with the data.head() method to provide an initial view of the dataset.

3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

* Handle Missing Values: The code converts the 'TotalCharges' column to numeric and fills in missing values with the mean of the column.
* Encode Categorical Variables: Categorical columns are identified and one-hot encoded using pd.get_dummies().
* Split Data into Training and Testing Sets: The dataset is divided into features (X) and the target variable (y). Then, it's split into training and testing sets using train_test_split().

4. Model Selection and Evaluation:

* A dictionary of machine learning models is defined, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.
* The script iterates through these models, performs cross-validated evaluation, and selects the best model based on accuracy.
* Train and Evaluate Best Model on Test Set: The best model is trained on the entire training set, and its accuracy is evaluated on the test set.

5. Address Class Imbalance with SMOTE: The script addresses class imbalance by oversampling the minority class using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). It then trains the best model on the resampled data and evaluates its accuracy.

6. Data Visualization:

* Pie Chart: A pie chart visualizes the distribution of churn and non-churn customers.
* Stacked Bar Chart: A stacked bar chart shows the churn by contract type.
* Line Chart: A line chart depicts the relationship between tenure and monthly charges.
* Histogram: A histogram visualizes the distribution of the 'TotalCharges' column.
* Scatter Plot: A scatter plot shows the relationship between tenure and monthly charges.
* Heat Map: A heatmap illustrates the correlation between different features in the dataset.

# The output of the code provides information about the machine learning model selection and evaluation process. Here's an explanation of each part of the output:

8. Cross-Validated Accuracy:

* For each machine learning model, the code performs cross-validation on the training data to evaluate the accuracy of the model.
* The following models are evaluated:
* Random Forest: Cross-Validated Accuracy is approximately 0.7895.
* Logistic Regression: Cross-Validated Accuracy is approximately 0.7982.
* Gradient Boosting: Cross-Validated Accuracy is approximately 0.7987.
* K-Nearest Neighbors: Cross-Validated Accuracy is approximately 0.7622.
* Support Vector Machine: Cross-Validated Accuracy is approximately 0.7345.
* Naive Bayes: Cross-Validated Accuracy is approximately 0.6565.
* Decision Tree: Cross-Validated Accuracy is approximately 0.7386.
* Best Model Selection:

9. The code selects the model with the highest cross-validated accuracy as the best model. In this case, the "Gradient Boosting" model has the highest accuracy of approximately 0.7987.
Best Model Accuracy:

10. The code reports the accuracy of the best model (Gradient Boosting) on the test set, which is approximately 0.8119.

11. Accuracy on Test Set after SMOTE:

After addressing class imbalance using SMOTE, the code evaluates the accuracy of the best model on the test set again. The accuracy is approximately 0.7757, which might have decreased slightly due to the resampling.
These accuracy values provide an indication of how well the machine learning models are performing in terms of classifying customer churn. A higher accuracy suggests a better model. The "Gradient Boosting" model is chosen as the best-performing model based on cross-validated accuracy and achieves an accuracy of approximately 0.8119 on the test set.
